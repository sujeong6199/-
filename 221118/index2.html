    <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typ
        esetting industry.</p>
    
    <p style="padding:10px; background-color:beige; color:brown;">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
         ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
     
          <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap int
        o electronic typeset
        ting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
